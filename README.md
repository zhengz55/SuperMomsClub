1. Must install Node to run server. Scripts use ajax to load part of the webpages, so without at least a local server it will not go well! Below is the link to download Node.js
After setting up the environment, type "node server.js" in terminal while in the local git directory to start the server.

2. We are using PostgreSQL to store client information. The first quarter of the page referenced by the link below should be enough to set up the database.

For table schemas, refer to er.txt

3. Currently no direct link to profile page. After starting server, use url localhost:3002/userProfile to see its contents.

4. Current TODOs:
-Refactor redundant css code into a main css file. 
-Implement user login.
-design sketches for blog posting, the shopping interface, as well as workshops.
